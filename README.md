## Installing

```shell
npm i reduceur immer
```

## Quick Start

```ts
import { createReducer } from "reduceur";

type State = {
  count: number;
};

// Note the double function call. This is a workaround to allow for partial inference.
const counterReducer = createReducer<State>()((draft) => ({
  incremented: () => {
    draft.count++;
  },
  decremented: () => {
    draft.count--;
  },
  changed: (payload: { count: number }) => {
    draft.count = payload.count;
  },
}));

const initialState = { count: 0 };
const nextState = counterReducer(
  initialState,
  // the event object is fully type-safe
  { type: "changed", count: 999 }
);

// With React
const [state, send] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });

// also fully type-safe!
send({ type: "changed", count: 22 });
```
